# dwm-status

`dwm-status` is a simple python program for setting `dwm status bar`. One special thing about `dwm-status` is, it loads or reads resources only when needed. If I'm reading `CPU` usage in every second it doesn't mean I have to read or load all the other resources (storage for example) each and every second right? So every `dwm-status-component` reads/load details independently from others.

### Requirements

Install following packages:

```
python3 (dwm-status is a python3 program)
lm_sensors (for reading CPU details)
amixer (for reading volume)
```

Internet connection: this is required to get the weather details (weather details are removed from the status bar when failed to get details)

## Weather Location Details:

This uses `http://wttr.in/<location>` endpoint to get weather details. So the location passed to `Weather` constructor will be replace `<location>` in the URL.

#### dwm_status.py

```python
status_list = [
    Weather("Colombo"),
]
```

## Volume Controls:

`Volume` component is listening to `SIGUSR1` custom signal and triggers `set_details()` method. Because it's using `@trigger_change_event` decorator, call to this method will trigger `update_status()`

```python
@on_signal
@trigger_change_event
def set_details(self):
	self.resources = self.get_details()
```

So if you run `kill -SIGUSR1 $(pgrep dwm_status.py)` in a terminal window will trigger `@on_signal` methods. So I automated this process using `sxhkd` as follows

#### .config/sxhkd/sxhkdrc

```bash
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------#
#                              independent hotkeys                             #
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------#
# make sxhkd reload its configuration files:
alt + Escape
	pkill -USR1 -x sxhkd

# runs when increase/decrease volume function keys are pressed
XF86Audio{Raise,Lower}Volume
    pactl set-sink-volume @DEFAULT_SINK@ {+10%,-10%} && kill -SIGUSR1 $(pgrep dwm_status.py)
```

## Running

make sure you got the permissions to execute
```bash
chmod -R u+x dwm-status/*
```

run `dwm_status.py` in a start up script (.xinirc)
#### .xinitrc
```
<path to dir>/dwm_status.py &
```
